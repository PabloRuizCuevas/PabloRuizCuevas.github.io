        summary: "The <b>M</b>odulation of <b>I</b>nt<b>E</b>nsity with <b>Z</b>ero <b>E</b>ffort (<b>MIEZE</b>) techinque is a neutron scattering method dedicated to inelastic measurements with low energy transfers that require a correspondingly high energy resolution. The MIEZE technique is closely related to time-of-flight methods based on the concept of Lamor-precession labeling in neutron resonance spin echo (NRSE)...",

The method consist in calculating the reduction factor using a random shaped region inside our region of interest, then we will calculate the reduction factor of this region, and choose a new random shaped region...",
