The MIEZE technique is closely related to time-of-flight methods based on the concept of Lamor-precession labeling in neutron resonance spin echo (NRSE)\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                As a time-of-flight like measurement technique, the quality of the MIEZE signal is sensitive to flight path differences of the neutrons scattered in the experimental setup. There are a few possible geometries for neutrom beam, the sample and the detector, but use the three axis geometry at MIRAII, depicted in the figure bellow, using three axis we have enough degrees of freedom to minimize the destructive interferences of the neutron beam.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3> Instrument geometry </h3>\n\n            <p> The destruction/damping of the MIEZE signal, caused by the neutrons flight path differences, compared to the undisturbed, only elastically scattered neutron beam is expressed by the reduction factor \\(R\\), which unintuitively is supposed to be as high, close to 1, as possible.\n                <label for=\"sn-1\" class=\"sidenote-toggle sidenote-number\"></label>\n                <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"sn-1\" class=\"sidenote-toggle\" />\n                <span class=\"sidenote\"> Tipically between 0 and 1 if we don't consider negative interferences, that can push it til -1. </span>\n            In this work we aim to calculate the reduction factor of a three-axis spectrometer (TAS) with enhanced energy resolution by means of an integrated MIEZE setup (MIEZETOP).
